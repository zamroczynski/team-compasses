# Team Compasses

This is an Addon for the multiplayer game BTW CE 3.0.0. "Team Compasses" introduces two new items: the Team 1 Compass and the Team 2 Compass. 
They function like the regular compass, but instead of pointing to the world spawn, they guide players to their team's rally point.

## Features:

* Two New Compasses: One for each team, designed to feel like a natural part of the game.
* Simple Crafting Recipes:
  * Compass + Red Flower = Team 1 Compass
  * Compass + Yellow Flower = Team 2 Compass
* Admin Command: Use /setbase <team> <x> <y> <z> to set or update the base location for the specified team.
* Default Behavior: If a team's base has not been set, the team compass will behave like a regular compass, pointing to the world spawn.

This is the perfect tool for organized multiplayer events, allowing players to focus on teamwork and competition instead of spending hours searching for their home base.

## Instalation:

Place the .jar file in the mods folder on both the client and server.

### Bugs:

* To ensure that the compass points in the correct direction, you must hold it in your hand.

#### Notification:
This is the first mod I have ever created. Please do not use it on your single-player worlds.
